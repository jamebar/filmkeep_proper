    <p>Filmkeep takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any User Content that you or any other user or third party posts or transmits using our Services.

    <h2><span>9.</span> Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, FILMKEEP SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR REVENUES, WHETHER INCURRED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, USE, GOOD-WILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, RESULTING FROM (A) YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF OR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; (B) ANY CONDUCT OR CONTENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY ON THE SERVICES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY DEFAMATORY, OFFENSIVE OR ILLEGAL CONDUCT OF OTHER USERS OR THIRD PARTIES; OR (C) UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS, USE OR ALTERATION OF YOUR TRANSMISSIONS OR CONTENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL FILMKEEP'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICES EXCEED ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS (U.S. $100.00).  </p>
    <h2><span>10.</span> Arbitration </h2> 
    <p>For any dispute you have with Filmkeep, you agree to first contact us and attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally. If Filmkeep has not been able to resolve the dispute with you informally, we each agree to resolve any claim, dispute, or controversy (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) arising out of or in connection with or relating to these Terms by binding arbitration by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under the Commercial Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes then in effect for the AAA, except as provided herein. Unless you and Filmkeep agree otherwise, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. Each party will be responsible for paying any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees in accordance with AAA rules. The award rendered by the arbitrator shall include costs of arbitration, reasonable attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses, and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from seeking injunctive or other equitable relief from the courts for matters related to data security, intellectual property or unauthorized access to the Service. ALL CLAIMS MUST BE BROUGHT IN THE PARTIES' INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, AND, UNLESS WE AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S CLAIMS. YOU AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND FILMKEEP ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.  </p>
    <h2><span>11.</span> Class Action Waiver</h2>
    <p>The parties agree that they will resolve their disputes on an individual basis. Any claims brought under this agreement must be brought in the parties' individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class, collective, or representative proceeding. This agreement also prevents any party from participating in a class action (existing or future) that was brought by any other party. Instead, the parties agree to resolve their disputes under this agreement on an individual basis. </p>

Filmkeep reserves the right to determine the form and means of providing notifications to you, and you agree to receive legal notices electronically if we so choose.

    <p>Assignment. These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Filmkeep without restriction. Any attempted transfer or assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.</p>
    <p>Entire Agreement/Severability. These Terms, together with the Privacy Policy and any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Filmkeep in connection with the Services, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Filmkeep concerning the Services. If any provision of these Terms is deemed invalid, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>
    <p>No Waiver. No waiver of any term of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Filmkeep's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
